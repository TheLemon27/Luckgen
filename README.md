# Luckgen

=== Welcome to Luckgen! ===

Luckgen is a tool for generating randomized symbols for the game Luck be a Landlord.

=== Intructions ===

Open Oatgen.bat
There should be a folder located in the Output folder called "RandomlyGeneratedSymbol(number)"
Locate your LBAL mod folder (How to locate your LBAL mod folder) A1. Right click the game in your steam library A2. Go to Manage > Browse local files A3. Run "LBAL Mod Uploader.exe" A4. Click the button that says "Open Mod Directory"
Copy the folder from the Output folder into the mod directory
Enjoy! :)

=== PLEASE NOTE ===

This tool currently randomly generates:
  - Value
  - Rarity
  - Group
  - & Effects/Description
The remaining things (Name, Image, etc.) is either hardcoded, or not randomized.

The mod files this tool generates (to my knowledge) only work for the Steam version of LBAL.

I created this tool for myself and am a casual programmer, so sorry if it's not the best.

This tool is open source, so feel free to tinker with it.

For now, all the symbols look the same, I was planning on giving the symbol's image a random tint when generated to distinguish them but I stopped when I realised I don't have the slightest idea on how to do that. So, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

==== Thank You and Have Fun! :) ====
